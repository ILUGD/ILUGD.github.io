        <p><b>General guideline: </b>
        Contributors and maintainers should participate in our project 
        and make our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, 
        body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, 
        education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or 
        sexual identity and orientation.

        <h2>Standards</h2>
        <p>These are some of the standards everyone is expected to follow:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Using welcoming and inclusive language</p></li>
            <li><p>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences</p></li>
            <li><p>Gracefully accepting constructive criticism</p></li>
            <li><p>Focusing on what is best for the community</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Resolving conflicts</h2>
        <p>Conflict is not bad , healthy debate 
            and disagreement often yield positive results. However, it is unacceptable
            to be disrespectful or to engage in behavior that violates the project’s 
            code of conduct.

            Complaints regarding violation of code of conduct , will be looked at seriously. If a person is
            found guilty of violating the programme's conduct , be it mentor or developer , he/she will be banned from the program 
            with immediate effect.
